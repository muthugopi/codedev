      <h2>Our Future Goals and Learning Community</h2>
      <p>As a team of passionate learners, we have come together to build a community for those who want to master web development â€” starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our vision is to create a space where even those with zero experience can learn, grow, and become confident front-end developers.

To support this goal, we have developed a dedicated website and a Discord community. The website serves as the central hub for tutorials, project ideas, community announcements, and resources. The Discord server acts as an active, real-time support group where members can ask questions, share progress, get feedback, and collaborate on projects.

Our future goals include:<br>

ðŸ”¹ Creating a structured roadmap for beginners, intermediate, and advanced learners.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Hosting live coding sessions and workshops on Discord.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Launching mini challenges and hackathons to help members practice real-world skills.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Introducing mentorship programs where experienced members guide new learners.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Expanding into advanced topics like React, APIs, and backend development later on.
<br>
By working together, we aim to not only learn but also build a supportive and inclusive environment where no one feels left behind. We believe coding should be fun, visual, and beginner-friendly â€” and that's exactly what we want our platform to reflect.
